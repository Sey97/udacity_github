### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
In this project, Python is used to understand and explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. I wrote code to import the data and answered interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. I also wrote a script that takes in raw input to build an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. The user is able to choose data and filter for a dataset to analyze.
